Many scene's will depend on Fibaro knowing if anybody is home. 
The trick will be to let the fibaro figure this out withou requirering a manual action, 
but in any case we need a variable where this information is stored and that can be used by the differen scene's
- Home = true/false
- Vacation = true/false				-- For some scene's it's important to know the difference between away for hours of for days / weeks
- Away = !Home or Vacation


Other scene's will need to know if you are sleeping or awake. In most cases these only apply when you are home.
- Sleeping = true/false;
- Awake = !Sleeping;


- Cycle = { Sleeping, Waking, GettingReadyToLeave, Day, Evening, GettingReadyForBed }
Cycle is the state of the house used for when you are at home. These parameter should be used in combination with Home/Away
	- Sleeping: No heat requirement, al lights should be off
	- Waking:	The transition period between 




Times
Some scene's will need to know in advance when something needs to happen. 
Your heating for example needs time adjust the temperature. It may take up to a few hours to reach the required temperature.
These variables define set time that can be used in certain scenario's
(The idea is to adjust these variable based on an alarm set, an aganda or a geolocating)
- WakeUpTime = "07:00"			 
- ExpectedHomeTime = "19:00"		-- Expected time I will be home (empty if not expected home that day)
- SleepTime = "24:00"				-- Expected time for going to sleep (this may be relative to the WakeUpTime if you want to ensure a certain amount of hours sleep)


Heating
The idea is to make all heating scene's follow the same global guidelines whenit come to required temperature
- Temperature = 19.5				-- The normal Temperature when at home
- TemperatureDrop_Away = 3			-- How much can the temperature drop when nodbody is home. 
 									-- Because somebody is expected to return within a (relatively) short amount of time the temperature should not drop to much 
- TemperatureDrop_Sleeping = 3		-- How much can the temperature drop when you are sleepinhg (might be the same as away, but this allows for the option that it is no
- Temperature_Minimal = 13			-- How much can the temperature drop when nodbody is home.
									-- When you stay away longer, the temperature can drop further, still there is a limit to how cold it can get. 								



Other
- DevicesToTurnOffWhenAwayOrSleeping = {0, 0, ...}				-- Devices you want shut donw when your not home (only put in devices that can be turne of washer may not be a good idee)
- DevicesToTurnBackOnWhenHomeAndAwake = {0, 0, ...} 			-- Only some of the devices should be turned back on when you get back home, 
																-- light should not be turned on just because you come home, but it would be nice if you could use your tv.
