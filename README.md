# JSFibaro
An attempt to share my personal Home Automation with Fibaro HC2

I'm currently in the progress of setting up my scenes. 
This is a very early version, most of the scenes I found somewhere and looked interesting.
I aim to build up this repository within the next few months and will sort and document the scenes and the ideas behind it. 

Feel free to grab whatever you can use :-) And I would welcome any ideas / contributions you have to offer.
